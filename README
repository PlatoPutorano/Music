Hi!
Do you want to listen to music?
Then you've come to the right place!!!
Sending music will take time. We'll have to wait.
For me to send you music, write a message like this:
/music 'author of the composition' 'title of the song'.
If the bot sent the wrong song that you were looking for, then enter the /next command.
I can also determine the name of the song from the lyrics.
To do this, you need to enter the command /text 'song lyrics'.
If this is not the song you were looking for, then enter the /next command.
I use AI. I find songs by text using AI. I hope you enjoy my music.
